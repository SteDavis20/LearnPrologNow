% Here are some more facts about them:

% The Englishman lives in the red house.
% The jaguar is the pet of the Spanish family.
% The Japanese lives to the right of the snail keeper.
% The snail keeper lives to the left of the blue house.

% Who keeps the zebra?
% Donâ€™t work it out for yourself: 
% define a predicate zebra/1 that tells you the nationality of the owner of the zebra!

% Hint:
